-> Python and Javascript packages

-> Focused on composition and modularity

-Models
    -> LLMS 20+ integrations
    -> chat Models
    -> Text Embedding Models: 10+ integrations
-Prompts
    -> Prompt Templates
    -> Output parsers: 5+ implementations
    -> Example Selectors: 5+ implementations
-Indexes
    -> Document Loaders: 50+ implementations
    -> Text Splitters: 10+ implementations
    -> Vector Sotres: 10+ implementations
    -> Retriever: 5+ integrations

-Chains
    - Prompt+ LLM + Output parsing
    - Can be used as building blocks for longer Chains
    - More application specific chains: 20+ types

-Agents
    -> Agent Types: 5+ types
       - Algorithm for getting LLMs to use tools
    -> Agent ToolKits: 10+ implementations
       - Agents armed with specific tools for a specific application

- Models, Prompts and parsers
    -> Prompts can be long and detailed
    -> Wrapping them in LangChain Prompt makes it easier to reuse
